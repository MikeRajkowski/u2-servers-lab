A U2 Basic program, SENDALERT, sends a hardware failure notification to a system administrator with the use of Python’s smtplib and Google Gmail SMTP server. The U2 Basic program prompts the user for the sender’s and recipient’s email addresses, message subject and body, Gmail username and password, and then calls the Python function sendalert().
The Python function sendalert() demonstrates the simplest way to send an email message using smtplib. For more interesting cases, such as email attachments and multiple recipients, there are additional helpful modules in Python, such as base64 and email.
