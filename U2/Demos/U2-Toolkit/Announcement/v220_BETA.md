## Async\Await and Entity Framework  6.1 in Rocket MV U2 Toolkit for .NET v2.2.0 (BETA) ##

You can avoid performance bottlenecks and enhance the overall responsiveness of your application by using asynchronous programming. Visual Studio  introduces a simplified approach, async programming, that leverages asynchronous support in the .NET Framework 4.5 . The compiler does the difficult work that the developer used to do, and your application retains a logical structure that resembles synchronous code. As a result, you get all the advantages of asynchronous programming with a fraction of the effort. Asynchrony proves especially valuable for applications that access the UI thread because all UI-related activity usually shares one thread. If any process is blocked in a synchronous application, all are blocked. When you use asynchronous methods, the application continues to respond to the UI. You can resize or minimize a window, for example, or you can close the application if you don't want to wait for it to finish. The Async and Await keywords in Visual Basic and the async and await keywords in C# are the heart of async programming.
 
 
We are delighted to announce that Rocket MV U2 Toolkit for .NET v2.2.0  will support  .NET Framework 4.5 asynchronous programming and Entity Framework 6.0  functionalities. For .NET Framework 4.5  Asynchronous Programming, it has implemented new ADO.NET API such as 
-          OpenAsync()
-          ReadAsync()
-          ExecuteReaderAsync()
-          ExecuteJsonAsync()
 
For Entity Framework 6.0 support, U2 Entity Data Provider is now compiled with Microsoft Entity Framework 6.0  DLL. Now you can generate  Entity Date Model and Code First Model using Entity Framework 6.0 and Rocket U2 MV Database.
 
These async/await features support following Application Areas.
 
1.       Web API (REST). It generates U2 async CRUD Web Methods (HTTP Service GET, PUT, POST , DELETE) in ASP.NET MVC Web API Project
2.       Responsive Desktop Application using WPF and WinForm
3.       Node.js/Edge.js. You can develop asynchronous programming  using C# async code and U2 Toolkit for .NET in  Edge.js
4.       Single Page Application (SPA) using Visual Studio 2013 Update 4, ASP.NET MVC, Razor, and Angular.js
5.       Windows Azure Mobile Services for Windows Phone, iOS and Android App Development
6.       Visual Studio 2013 update 4 tools for Apache Cordova and Web API (REST)/Web Methods using U2 subroutines, SQL Access and Native Access
7.       …more…
 
We will start BETA in Mid-January, 2015. If you want to join BETA, please contact us u2askus@rocketsoftware.com
